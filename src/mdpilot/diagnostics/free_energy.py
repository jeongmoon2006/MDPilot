"""Read a metadynamics HILLS file back into a free-energy surface.

Until now the deposited bias was write-only: HILLS accumulated on disk and
nothing ever read it, so rounds after a `switch_to_metad` were still judged by
the *unbiased* convergence rubric — block-averaged RMSD, ESS, bimodality. Those
statistics describe an equilibrium ensemble. A biased trajectory is not one:
the bias actively drives the observable, so a long τ_int means the bias is
still filling, and a bimodal marginal means the bias worked rather than that
the system is exploring freely. Reading them as convergence evidence is a
category error.

What replaces them is the free-energy surface itself, plus the standard
well-tempered convergence check: integrate HILLS at increasing time strides and
ask whether the surface has stopped changing.

Summation is delegated to `plumed sum_hills` rather than reimplemented. The
arithmetic looks trivial — sum Gaussians on a grid — but PLUMED writes
well-tempered heights pre-scaled by γ/(γ-1) and deposits *stretched* Gaussians
by default (`#! SET kerneltype stretched-gaussian`), so a hand-rolled sum would
silently disagree with the file it claims to integrate.

    A walker that never left its starting basin produces a surface that stops

    converged is the same error as a metastable basin reading as a converged
    plateau, one level up.

    So convergence also requires the walker to have gone back and forth over
    the barrier: a well-tempered surface is trustworthy once the CV is
    diffusing across the region, not merely once the first basin is full.

    `min_recrossings` is how many transitions count as "back and forth".
    `count_recrossings` increments once per transition, so a one-way A -> B
    trip scores 1 and a full A -> B -> A round trip scores 2. The default of
    1 accepts a one-way crossing; a task whose criterion is a full round trip
