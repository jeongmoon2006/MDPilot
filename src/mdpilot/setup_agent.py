"""Natural-language request -> a reviewable task file.

The one place an LLM is invoked outside the round loop. `scientist.decide` runs
once per round; this runs once per campaign, before any compute, and its output
is a file a human reads before anything starts.

Why this does not violate the MDCrow anti-goal (D5). What that anti-goal
forbids is rebuilding an LLM *agent layer that orchestrates setup tools* —
a model driving PDBFixer, Modeller and `gmx` from a prompt. Nothing here runs:
the model emits a structured proposal, `task_file.load_task_file` validates it,
a human reviews it, and deterministic Python builds the simulation. That is the
same boundary `cv_designer` draws for the biased CV — the model proposes, code
resolves. D5's own closing line is the trigger being pulled here: "revisit only
when a campaign genuinely needs setup-from-natural-language."

Three design choices worth keeping:

- **Tool use, not YAML text.** The model fills a strict schema and this module
  renders the YAML. A syntactically invalid task file is therefore
  unrepresentable, and the only failures left are semantic ones the loader can
  explain.
- **No similarity retrieval.** This is one call per *campaign*, so there is no
  cost pressure to trim context — the whole corpus goes in every time. The
  per-round retrieval in `scientist.py` exists because it repeats every round;
  that argument does not transfer here.
- **The loader is the judge.** A proposal is not accepted because it looks
  plausible but because `load_task_file` accepts it. When it does not, the
  loader's own message goes back to the model, which is a far better signal
  than a rubric — it names the field and the constraint.
