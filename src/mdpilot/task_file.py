"""Load a task file into the arguments `run_campaign` takes.

A task file is the one thing a user (or, later, a setup agent) writes to
describe a campaign. It already existed as `benchmarks/tasks/*.yaml` and was
almost entirely decorative: `run_cln025.py` read `starting_pdb`,
`task_expectation`, `sampling` and `done_criterion`, and every other declared
field — force field, water model, padding, ionic strength, timestep,
constraints, observable, target ESS — was documentation the adapters were free
to contradict. Nothing checked that `padding_nm: 1.0` in the file was the
`_PADDING_NM = 1.0` in the adapter.

This module makes the file load-bearing, in three modes per field:

- **Mapped** — turned into a `SystemSpec`/`Ensemble` or a `run_campaign`
  keyword. These are the parameters that are actually tunable today.
- **Verified** — not yet tunable, but declared in the file, so the value is
  checked against the constant that really governs it and a mismatch raises.
  This is the point of the module: a task file may not quietly disagree with
  the code. `padding_nm: 1.5` gets an error naming the fixed value rather than
  silently running at 1.0.
- **Informational** — prose and provenance (`description`, `starting_state`,
  `observable.selection`). Carried, not interpreted.

Anything else raises. Unknown keys are how a generated file's typos surface,
and a setup agent will produce those.

The verified values are the *OpenMM* adapter's, since that is `run_campaign`'s
default engine. `forcefield` in particular is engine-specific — GROMACS runs
amber99sb-ildn, which is a different force field, not a translation of
`amber14-all.xml` — so a GROMACS campaign declaring it needs an engine-keyed
table here. Deferred until a task file actually targets GROMACS.
