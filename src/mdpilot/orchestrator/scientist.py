"""LLM-driven decision step of the campaign loop.

Per `docs/architecture.md`, this is the only place an LLM is invoked. The
mechanical loop calls `decide()` once per round with the diagnostic report
bundle, hypothesis ledger, prior round summaries, and (M4) a free-form
task-encoded expectation, and gets back a structured choice whose action
space depends on the campaign phase (see below).

Implementation notes:
- Phase-dependent contract (M4). A campaign has two phases and the scientist
  sees a different report and a different action space in each:
    * `vanilla` — the equilibrium convergence bundle from `diagnostics.report`,
      action space `extend | stop | switch_to_metad`.
    * `metad` — the free-energy bundle from `diagnostics.free_energy`, action
      space `extend | stop`. The equilibrium verdicts are *absent*, not
      relabelled: a biased trajectory is not an equilibrium ensemble, so
      `plateau_reached` / `ess` / `exploring` do not describe convergence
      there. Omitting them makes the category error unrepresentable rather
      than merely discouraged. A second `switch_to_metad` is out of scope (the
      loop ends the campaign for human review), so it is dropped from the
      biased tool schema instead of being emitted and rejected.
- Action space (vanilla): `extend | stop`, plus `switch_to_metad` when a
  `task_expectation` was supplied — that string is the only thing the pivot
  rule compares against, so without it the campaign is a pure convergence task
  and the action is dropped from the enum rather than left available and
  discouraged in prose. On `switch_to_metad` the model also returns a
  `MetadProposal` — a structured CV proposal in the same shape
  `cv_designer.CVProposal` consumes (cv_type, MDTraj selection strings,
  label). Bias parameters (sigma, height, pace) are *not* in the
  model's output: they are physics-unit numbers, derivable deterministically
  from the prior trajectory and from rule-of-thumb constants; a small helper
  in `sampling/` will fill them at the point of use (step 4 of the M4 plan).
- Model: Sonnet 4.6 — bumped from M1's Haiku 4.5 because the action is now
  ternary with structured chemistry reasoning (CV selection, transition
  timescale judgment). The wrong CV ends a campaign in wasted compute; cost
  per round is small next to that. `model` is parameter-overridable so unit
  tests stay cheap (mocked) and live tests can pin a tier.
- Output: Anthropic tool use with `strict: true` and forced `tool_choice`.
  Strict mode restricts the usable JSON Schema vocabulary — `minItems` /
  `maxItems` on an array are rejected with a 400, so array arity is validated
  downstream in `cv_designer` rather than declared here.
  `metad_proposal` is a nullable object so the discriminated union stays in
  one tool call; the cross-field invariant (`metad_proposal` non-null iff
  decision == switch_to_metad) is enforced in `decide()`'s parser.
- Prompt assembly: the system prompt is retrieved per round from the
  Markdown knowledge base in `mdpilot/knowledge/`, keyed on the same facts
  that select the tool schema (phase, whether a CV proposal is possible,
  whether a CV switch is offered). A round is never shown rules it cannot
  act on — a biased round gets no equilibrium rubric, a pure-convergence
  campaign gets no CV vocabulary. See `build_system_prompt`.
- Caching: `cache_control` on the assembled system prompt. There are four
  possible assemblies and the prompt is constant within a campaign phase, so
  each variant caches after its first round. The render order is tools →
  system → messages, so a breakpoint on the system block caches the tool
  schema *with* it: the ~715-token tool sits inside the cached prefix, not
  before it. That is what keeps even the smallest assembly clear of Sonnet
  4.6's 1024-token minimum — a pure-convergence vanilla round is a
  1,014-token system block but a 1,729-token prefix, and it does cache
  (measured `cache_read_input_tokens` 1,413 on the second call). Retrieval
  therefore never trims a round out of the cache; an earlier note here
  claiming the smallest assembly might miss it compared the system block
  against the minimum instead of the prefix. That same render order is why
  swapping the tool at the pivot invalidates the prefix for one round — the
  same round the assembly changes anyway.

    right actions against the wrong numbers.

    `task_expectation` also gates the pivot. It is the only input the
    switch_to_metad rule has to compare against, so with none supplied the
    campaign is a pure convergence task and `switch_to_metad` is dropped from
    the vanilla enum. Not merely tidier: a pivot from such a campaign also has
    no `state_thresholds`, and the biased phase would then count recrossings
    against whichever two basins are currently deepest (F9).

    `allow_cv_switch` adds `switch_cv` to the biased action space. The caller
    owns that budget: once the campaign has spent its allowance the action is
    dropped from the enum rather than refused after the fact, so the model
    never emits a decision the loop will not honour.

    `max_extra_ns` is the ceiling the loop clamps an extend request to. Shown

    been committed with a switch nothing can build. The error text goes back
