Populate `metad_proposal` when you choose the action that (re)defines the
biased coordinate: `switch_to_metad` in the vanilla phase, `switch_cv` or
`add_cv` in the biased phase. Your tool's `decision` enum says which of the two is available
this round, and never both:

- `cv_type` — one of `distance`, `torsion`, `gyration`, `rmsd`, `contacts`.
Pick the type that matches the physical coordinate you believe is slow. Note
that `distance`, `gyration` and `rmsd` are unbounded above, so a bias on them
can drive the system into an ever-larger unfolded space and never return;
`torsion` and `contacts` are bounded on both sides, which removes that
failure mode.

Bounded is not the same as reversible. A contact count collapses every
disordered conformation onto roughly the same value, so once the system is
disordered the coordinate cannot tell those states apart and the bias fills one
degenerate bin without ever pushing the system back. A real campaign left the
folded state, sat between 0.03 and 0.13 of its native contacts for two rounds
while the deposited bias grew past 115 kJ/mol — an order of magnitude beyond
any real folding free energy — and never recrossed. Ask not only whether a
coordinate is bounded but whether it distinguishes states on *both* sides well
enough to lead the system back.
- `selections` — MDTraj selection strings. Arity is type-specific:
- `distance`: 2 selections, each must resolve to exactly 1 atom. Example:
`["name CA and resSeq 1", "name CA and resSeq 10"]`.
- `torsion`: 4 selections, each must resolve to exactly 1 atom. Example:
`["resSeq 2 and name N", "resSeq 2 and name CA", "resSeq 2 and name C",
"resSeq 3 and name N"]`.
- `gyration`: 1 selection, must resolve to ≥2 atoms. Example: `["backbone and
resSeq 1 to 10"]`.
- `rmsd`: 1 selection, must resolve to ≥3 atoms. RMSD to the campaign's
reference structure after optimal superposition — the usual folding order
parameter. Example: `["name CA"]`.
- `contacts`: 1 selection, must resolve to ≥2 atoms. The *fraction* of native
contacts formed among the selected atoms, on [0, 1]: 1 is the reference
structure's full set, 0 is none. Every number you see for it — the biased
coordinate, `cv_min`/`cv_max`, the free-energy axis — is that fraction, not a
count. Pairs closer than 3 residues in sequence are excluded, since those are
formed in any conformation.
Example: `["name CA"]`. For folding and unfolding this is usually a better
coordinate than `rmsd`: it measures how much of the native structure is
present rather than how far the whole chain has moved, and because it is
bounded the unfolded side cannot run away.
- `label` — short snake_case identifier (e.g. `rg_back`, `d_term`). It MUST
name the coordinate you are actually biasing. Do not name it after a
coordinate you would have preferred but did not select: the label is written
into plumed.dat, HILLS, COLVAR and every downstream report, and a label that
misdescribes the CV makes the run unreadable afterwards. If you want RMSD,
choose `cv_type: rmsd` — do not call a `distance` an rmsd.

Bias parameters (sigma, height, pace) are *not* your concern — a deterministic
helper computes them from the prior trajectory.

When not switching, `metad_proposal` must be null.
