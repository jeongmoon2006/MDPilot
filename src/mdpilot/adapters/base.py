"""Adapter Protocol for MD engines.

The campaign loop in `orchestrator/loop.py` talks to engines exclusively
through this Protocol. Adding a new engine (GROMACS, NAMD, etc.) means
writing a new class that implements these methods; no changes to the
loop or to the scientist are required.

The engine also declares the two physics constants the loop reasons in —
`timestep_fs` (to convert nanoseconds to steps) and `temperature_k` (which
PLUMED's well-tempered scaling and the kT convergence threshold are taken
against). Both were previously hardcoded in the loop as values that merely
happened to agree with both adapters.

Lifecycle:
  1. construct(work_dir=..., seed=..., [engine-specific args])
  2. prepare()             # idempotent: cache structures to disk
  3. start()               # build engine state, write topology_path
  4. repeat:
     - load_checkpoint(path)            # optional, for resume
     - run_steps(n, trajectory_path=…)  # advance + record
     - save_checkpoint(path)            # persist resumable state

The topology written by `start()` and any trajectories written by
`run_steps()` must be loadable by mdtraj — diagnostics live one level up
and don't care which engine produced them.

Optional extension, not part of the Protocol: `export_state_xml()` /
`load_state_xml(xml)`. A checkpoint is bound to its System and cannot cross
a change of bias; an engine that can hand the walker's positions and
velocities across as a portable object lets the loop warm-start a pivot or a
CV revision from where the walker is rather than from the cached start. The
loop uses it when the adapter offers it (`OpenMMAdapter` does) and falls
back to the cache otherwise.
