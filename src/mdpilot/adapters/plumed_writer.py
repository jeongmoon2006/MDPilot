"""Generate PLUMED input files from typed CV + bias specifications.

PLUMED is the de facto standard for biased MD in academic research:
metadynamics, umbrella sampling, well-tempered metaD, free-energy
calculations all share the same input-file format. MDPilot's scientist
proposes CVs and bias parameters; this writer turns those proposals
into the plumed.dat text the engines read.

Runtime PLUMED is *not* a build-time dependency of this module — it
generates text. The OpenMM adapter handles the optional runtime import
(``openmmplumed``) separately. This split lets us develop and unit-test
the writer locally without requiring a working PLUMED install; the
"bias actually acts" verification happens on AWS where we control the
environment (D6 step 5).

Atom-indexing convention: this module accepts **0-based** atom indices
to match the rest of the codebase (OpenMM, mdtraj). PLUMED's text
format is 1-based; the writer converts on output. Callers should never
hand-encode the +1 themselves.
