"""What the campaign measures, and how to compute it from a trajectory.

The campaign observable is the one 1-D series every phase is judged on: the
vanilla convergence bundle summarizes it, and the biased phase counts
recrossings against the task's own state thresholds *on it* rather than on
whichever CV the scientist chose to bias (F7, F9). Until now it was hardcoded
as CA-RMSD to the campaign topology, so `campaign_observable` began with
``topology.select("protein and name CA")`` and raised on an empty selection —
which made every non-protein campaign impossible at round one.

The generalization is deliberately not a new abstraction. An observable is a
collective variable, and `sampling/` already knows how to resolve and compute
five of them; `bias_designer.cv_series` is the engine. So an `ObservableSpec`
is a `CVProposal` plus a display name and a unit scale, and this module is the
thin layer that keeps the two uses — "size the bias from this coordinate" and
"judge the campaign on this coordinate" — computing the same thing.

`rmsd` is the one type computed directly here rather than through
`cv_designer`. PLUMED's RMSD action needs a reference *file*, which
`design_cv` writes; the campaign observable measures against the campaign
topology already in memory, so routing it through a written PDB would add a
file and an opportunity for the two references to differ.
