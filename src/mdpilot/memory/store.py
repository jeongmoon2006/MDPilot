"""SQLite-backed campaign state for resume-from-disk.

One SQLite file per campaign at ``<work_dir>/state.db``. Three tables:

- ``campaign`` — singleton row (id = 1) holding the immutable run config.
  Re-opening with a different config raises so a half-finished campaign
  can't be silently restarted under new parameters.
- ``rounds`` — one row per completed round (PK = round_index). Existence
  of a row is the source of truth for "this round is done". The matching
  OpenMM checkpoint must be written *before* the row is inserted so we
  never see a row without a usable resume point.
- ``ledger`` — the hypothesis ledger. Append-only structured notes the
  scientist writes during decide() to track persistent observations
  across rounds (e.g. "vanilla MD will not fold chignolin in 100 ns",
  "phi torsion is the slow coordinate"). Multiple notes per round
  allowed; the next decide call is shown all prior notes as context.

Trajectories and checkpoints stay on the filesystem; this DB only stores
their paths plus the compact diagnostic report, decision, and ledger.

# --- campaign config compatibility -----------------------------------------
#
# The campaign config is the resume guard: `init_campaign` refuses to reopen a
# campaign whose parameters have changed, because prior rounds were produced
# under the old ones. Comparing the serialized JSON byte-for-byte made that
# guard brittle in one specific way — *adding* a config key stranded every
# campaign already on disk, since their stored config could not contain a key
# that did not exist when they started. Four real campaigns were stranded that
# way before this existed, by the commits that added `state_thresholds` and
# `min_recrossings`.
#
# The fix is to compare *meaning* rather than bytes: fill in, for each key that
# postdates the campaign table, the value that was in force before that key
# existed. A campaign that predates a key then resumes when the requested value
# matches what it actually ran under, and is still refused when it does not.
#
# This is read-time normalization only. The stored config is never rewritten —
# a campaign's record should say what was actually recorded, not what a later
# version of the code would have written.

# Written since the campaign table existed. Their absence from a stored config
# is not something that can be interpreted, so it is left to fail loudly.
