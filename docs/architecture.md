# MDPilot Architecture

A closed-loop scientific reasoning agent for molecular dynamics simulations.

> An MD operator runs the simulation you describe.
> An MD scientist decides what to simulate next.
> MDPilot is the latter.

## Thesis

Existing MD agents (MDCrow, DynaMate, NAMD-Agent, the various MDAgent projects, PolyJarvis, MatSciAgent) all focus on the inner loop: **setup → submit → analyze**. They are MD *operators*. They run the simulation you describe and return the result.

The outer loop — looking at results, judging whether they're adequate for the question, and deciding what to simulate next — is largely unsolved. MDPilot is a specialist for this outer loop.

## Position in the field

Setup, parameterization, execution, and basic analysis are well-handled by existing agents. MDPilot delegates these via adapters and focuses entirely on:

1. **Convergence and adequacy judgment** — when is a trajectory "done"? Does it answer the question that was asked?
2. **Enhanced sampling decisions** — when vanilla MD is inadequate, pick metadynamics CVs, REMD ladders, umbrella windows.
3. **Hypothesis-driven follow-up** — given what we just saw, what should we run next?
4. **Ensemble reasoning** — coherent inference across multiple replicas, temperatures, conditions.

If a contribution can be summarized as "MDCrow with X," it doesn't belong in MDPilot.

## Architecture principles

### One persistent agent + ephemeral subagents

MDPilot is a *single persistent agent* (the scientist) that owns the campaign narrative end-to-end. Bounded subtasks are dispatched to *ephemeral fresh-context subagents* that return structured artifacts and die.

This is **not** a multi-agent design pattern. There are no multiple persistent agents communicating in natural language. Subagents are function calls with their own scratch context, not collaborators. Lifecycle: spawn → process bounded input → return structured output → terminate.

The test for spawning a subagent: does the subtask have a clean input and a structured output? If yes, subagent. If it needs the campaign narrative to make sense, it stays with the scientist.

`setup_agent.py` is the worked example: bounded input (a sentence plus a fixed corpus), structured output (a task file), no need for campaign narrative, and it dies when the file is written. It runs *before* the loop, so the scientist still sees exactly one LLM call per round.

### The task file is the campaign contract

One YAML file defines a campaign, and every field in it is in one of three
modes:

| mode | meaning |
|---|---|
| **mapped** | a real parameter — system, force field, padding, ensemble, equilibration, seed, observable, thresholds, budgets |
| **verified** | not yet tunable, but checked against the constant that governs it, so the file cannot disagree with the run |
| **informational** | prose, carried not interpreted |

Anything else is refused. The verified mode is the load-bearing one: a task
file that *declares* a 1.0 nm cutoff and a run that uses 1.2 would otherwise be
undetectable, and the file would slowly become documentation nobody trusts.
`benchmarks/tasks/cln025_contacts.yaml` is a fully commented example.

### Externalized state

The hypothesis ledger, findings log, and trajectory store live on disk (SQLite + filesystem) — not in the agent's context window. The scientist reads what it needs each round and writes back what it learned. Context is for active reasoning, not memory.

### Structured tool returns

Tools never dump raw logs, trajectories, or large files into context. Returns are compact JSON summaries plus filesystem paths. If the agent needs detail, it re-fetches a specific slice.

### Hierarchical round summaries

After each round (simulate → analyze → decide), a structured round summary is generated and persisted. The active context becomes:

- Current round in detail
- Structured summaries of all prior rounds
- Pinned hypothesis ledger and current plan

Full traces stay on disk for provenance and reproducibility.

## File structure

Two things are shown together below: what exists today, and the shape the
roadmap is heading toward. **Lines marked `[planned]` are not in the tree** —
they are milestones, not modules. Check the repository before assuming a path
here is importable; this section has drifted from reality before, and
`CLAUDE.md` sends coding sessions here to verify load-bearing decisions.

**Deliberately not built, though earlier drafts of this file listed them.**
`tools/` — the scientist has no tool-dispatch layer; the loop calls
`decide()` directly and everything else is deterministic Python. That is what
"the LLM is called once per round" means in practice — plus one call per
*campaign*, in `setup_agent.py`, before the loop starts.
`diagnostics/effective_sample_size.py` — ESS is returned by
`autocorrelation.py` rather than living alone. `orchestrator/planner.py`,
`replanner.py` and `state.py` — `loop.py` is the state machine and there is no
separate plan artifact yet.

## Tech choices

- **LLM:** Claude via the Anthropic SDK
- **MD engines:** OpenMM (direct), GROMACS (direct). MDCrow delegation deferred indefinitely — D5.
- **Memory:** SQLite + filesystem (start simple, swap later if justified)
- **HPC:** Slurm-aware execution layer (Milestone 5)
- **Analysis:** MDTraj
- **Enhanced sampling:** PLUMED
