# MDPilot Architecture

A closed-loop scientific reasoning agent for molecular dynamics simulations.

> An MD operator runs the simulation you describe.
> An MD scientist decides what to simulate next.
> MDPilot is the latter.

## Thesis

Existing MD agents (MDCrow, DynaMate, NAMD-Agent, the various MDAgent projects, PolyJarvis, MatSciAgent) all focus on the inner loop: **setup → submit → analyze**. They are MD *operators*. They run the simulation you describe and return the result.

The outer loop — looking at results, judging whether they're adequate for the question, and deciding what to simulate next — is largely unsolved. MDPilot is a specialist for this outer loop.

## Position in the field

Setup, parameterization, execution, and basic analysis are well-handled by existing agents. MDPilot delegates these via adapters and focuses entirely on:

1. **Convergence and adequacy judgment** — when is a trajectory "done"? Does it answer the question that was asked?
2. **Enhanced sampling decisions** — when vanilla MD is inadequate, pick metadynamics CVs, REMD ladders, umbrella windows.
3. **Hypothesis-driven follow-up** — given what we just saw, what should we run next?
4. **Ensemble reasoning** — coherent inference across multiple replicas, temperatures, conditions.

If a contribution can be summarized as "MDCrow with X," it doesn't belong in MDPilot.

## Architecture principles

### One persistent agent + ephemeral subagents

MDPilot is a *single persistent agent* (the scientist) that owns the campaign narrative end-to-end. Bounded subtasks are dispatched to *ephemeral fresh-context subagents* that return structured artifacts and die.

This is **not** a multi-agent design pattern. There are no multiple persistent agents communicating in natural language. Subagents are function calls with their own scratch context, not collaborators. Lifecycle: spawn → process bounded input → return structured output → terminate.

The test for spawning a subagent: does the subtask have a clean input and a structured output? If yes, subagent. If it needs the campaign narrative to make sense, it stays with the scientist.

### Externalized state

The hypothesis ledger, findings log, and trajectory store live on disk (SQLite + filesystem) — not in the agent's context window. The scientist reads what it needs each round and writes back what it learned. Context is for active reasoning, not memory.

### Structured tool returns

Tools never dump raw logs, trajectories, or large files into context. Returns are compact JSON summaries plus filesystem paths. If the agent needs detail, it re-fetches a specific slice.

### Hierarchical round summaries

After each round (simulate → analyze → decide), a structured round summary is generated and persisted. The active context becomes:

- Current round in detail
- Structured summaries of all prior rounds
- Pinned hypothesis ledger and current plan

Full traces stay on disk for provenance and reproducibility.
